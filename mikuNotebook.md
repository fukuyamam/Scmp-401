#### January 30, 2018
Met with Professor Glandon and Bennett to discuss project ideas.

Meeting notes:
- Stock returns are forecastable in the medium to long run
- Use the latest thinking on forecasting future distribution of returns
  - Use price-earnings ratio of market and some measure of volatility
  - Write a function that takes starting value, number of years to simulate, expected returns, and standard deviation of returns as inputs. Output is a vector of length n where n is the number of years to simulate with each row corresponding to a year in the future.
- Will be using Python

Seminar Presentation #1

*Reflection:*
My first seminar presentation was quite nervewracking, as I am really not skilled at public speaking. However, I believe that public speaking is a critical skill to have and hope to improve with each presentation.

Before my next presentation (which is next class), I will email Rachel a list of fields that I think should be included in the workflow and hopefully receive some feedback and some data to work with. I will also make a test workflow in Google Sheets to familiarize myself with its functions, pivot tables, and Google Apps Script and try to figure out how I will use these resources in the workflow.

Seminar Presentation #2

*Reflection:*
I think that my second seminar presentation was really helpful, and I liked that people were able to chime in and ask thought-provoking questions. I also received helpful questions to ask Rachel some more about the system.

#### Week of February 19, 2018
I was able to use the countif function in Google Sheets to create a static version of the age data, and then with the identify function I was able to create a dynamic version of the age data, where the only necessary input is the number of entries, which the person that would be normalizing the data would have to enter.

Seminar Presentation #3

*Reflection:*
I think that my third seminar presentation went better than any of my other presentations. I felt slightly more comfortable speaking, and again, people gave very helpful feedback and gave me ideas that I had never thought of. I was having a lot of trouble normalizing the time data using regex, but one of my classmates informed me that hourly data can be compared in Google sheets so that regex would not be necessary.
