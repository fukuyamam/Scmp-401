Met with Professor Glandon and Bennett to discuss project ideas.

Meeting notes:
- Stock returns are forecastable in the medium to long run
- Use the latest thinking on forecasting future distribution of returns
  - Use price-earnings ratio of market and some measure of volatility
  - Write a function that takes starting value, number of years to simulate, expected returns, and standard deviation of returns as inputs. Output is a vector of length n where n is the number of years to simulate with each row corresponding to a year in the future.
- Will be using Python

Seminar Presentation #1

*Reflection:*
My first seminar presentation was quite nervewracking, as I am really not skilled at public speaking. However, I believe that public speaking is a critical skill to have and hope to improve with each presentation.

Before my next presentation (which is next class), I will email Rachel a list of fields that I think should be included in the workflow and hopefully receive some feedback and some data to work with. I will also make a test workflow in Google Sheets to familiarize myself with its functions, pivot tables, and Google Apps Script and try to figure out how I will use these resources in the workflow.

Seminar Presentation #2

*Reflection:*
I think that my second seminar presentation was really helpful, and I liked that people were able to chime in and ask thought-provoking questions. I also received helpful questions to ask Rachel some more about the system.
